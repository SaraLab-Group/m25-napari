## Installation
This repository was tested with CUDA 11.2 and cuDNN 8.1 pre-installed on Windows 10. For install please use the latest development version :

    git clone https://github.com/SaraLab-Group/m25-napari.git
    cd m25-napari
    conda env create -f ./environment.yml
    conda activate m25-napari
    pip install -e .
    
## Usage
Launch:
```python
napari -w m25-napari
```
The module can be run by running `napari`in the command line and selecting `m25-napari:M25 Controls` under Plugins. By Default, the demo mode is set which skips the connection to the PSoC Timing controller and the cameras and allows viewing of the GUI through Napari. If the user has setup the controller and cameras, the demo mode can be turned off by setting `demo_mode = False` in the file `src/visualizer/_widgetFunctions.py`.
